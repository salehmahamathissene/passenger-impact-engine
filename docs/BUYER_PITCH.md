# PIE Buyer Pitch (1-page)

## What PIE does
Passenger Impact Engine (PIE) forecasts **airline disruption cost exposure** using Monte Carlo simulation.
It focuses on **EU261 passenger compensation risk** and related operational impact.

## Who it is for
- Operations Control Center (OCC) / Disruption Management
- Risk & Compliance
- Finance / Revenue Management
- Customer Experience (rebooking + compensation exposure)

## The pain (what buyers care about)
Disruptions create unpredictable cost:
- EU261 compensation payouts
- re-accommodation and handling costs
- downstream schedule disruption (missed connections, crew knock-on effects)

## What PIE outputs (operator language)
For a given disruption scenario, PIE estimates:
- **Expected compensation exposure (€)**
- **95% worst-case exposure (€)**
- Distribution of payouts (risk curve)
- Scenario comparison (e.g., delay vs cancellation vs rebooking strategy)

## Why this matters
Instead of guessing, teams can quantify:
- “How bad can this disruption get financially?”
- “Which mitigation reduces expected loss the most?”
